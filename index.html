Hey there! <br><br>

This is a honeypot experiment project. <br>
It exposes a gigantic list of http ressources (empty files) with a valid path and filename. Generally bot (simply scripts in Python, JavaScript, Bash, etc) look for some valid path which is normally not present part of the visible website; Hopefully they find some valuable leaks.
In addition to the clear deed ethically, so many regulations forbid spams and bots who clearly try to look for leaks. <br> <br>

Additional note: This is my own concept of a functional honeypot. Feel free to deploy. Please link to this repository https://github.com/yanna92yar/honeypot/

Finally HOST ONLY ON YOUR PLATFORM. DO NOT ABUSE. <br>
<hr>
<q>It is now hosted on Github on the current link: https://yanna92yar.github.io for fun. AS SOON AS I FIND A HIGH TRAFFIC ON GITHBU PAGES SECTION (like > 1000 visits daily or so), I TAKE PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY TO DROP IT.</q>
